## About

Squzy Incident allow user to analyze the information received from application, checker or agent. 
For that user define his own rules, which would be working on each storage update.

Squzy doesn't lock the user down with the restricted number of rules.
Instead of that, it allows user to create his own rules!

Do you want to have a simply incident if the overload of all processors is more than 90%? No problem!

Or do you want  to have an incident when one of the last 77 measurements of all CPU’s load is 99%, every of the 10 last memory measurements has less than 512 Mb free memory and there is less than 2 Gb free space on one of the disks now? You are welcome!

In order to give user ability to create his own incident rules without restrictions, we’ve taken the [**expr**](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr) library and expanded it with our own definitions (watch incident-rules).

If you can’t create some rule you want to have - let us know.

And now few technical details.

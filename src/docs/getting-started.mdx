title: 'Getting started'
---

The best way yo start is by using our starter:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:squzy/starter.git
cd starter
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
```

After that open [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80)

For add basic host minitoring

```bash
SQUZY_AGENT_SERVER_HOST=localhost:9091 ./squzy_agent_v1.7.0-darwin-amd64
```

But, if you prefer, you can install and configure manually from our [release page](https://github.com/squzy/squzy/releases).

Once you have installed the dependencies you will need to create the [navigation](/usage/navigation) and [documentation](/usage/creating-docs) file.


After that, you are ready ðŸš€

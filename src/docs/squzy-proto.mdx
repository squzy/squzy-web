title: 'Squzy proto'
---

Squzy uses GRPC protocol for connection between parts. 
That means you can have your own implementation of some parts of Squzy in case the provided implementation doesn't suit you for some reasons.

[Here](https://github.com/squzy/squzy_proto) you can find all proto definitions used in Squzy.
